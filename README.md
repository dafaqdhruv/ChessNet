# Thanks and Inspirations
Huge thanks to OneLoneCoder ([JavidX9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder)) and his [video series](https://youtu.be/2hNdkYInj4g) on Networking in C++ using ASIO.

The Networking module of this project has been inspired from his [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

## How to build
Download and Install ASIO from [here](https://think-async.com/Asio/)  or from Boost C++ library.

or check your package manager for easier setup.
